Welcome to the RC Car Pico project! This project was completed in 2023, but I am now just posting it to github a year later.
Here is what the final model looks like:

The components consisted of:
- 1x Raspberry Pi Pico W
- 1x I2C Display**
- 1x USB Portable Charger
- 2x 9v Batteries
- 2x Motor Drivers
- 4x Motor + Rubber Wheels

Cardboard was used for the frame, with zip-ties and velcro-straps to hold everything down.

** The Pico does not pull enough power on its own, which would cause the portable charger to shut down. My workaround was to connect a spare LCD display to ensure enough power was being drawn to not trigger a shut down.
